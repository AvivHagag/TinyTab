# TinyTab Privacy Policy

TinyTab respects your privacy. The extension operates entirely locally on your device and is designed to protect your data.

## Information We Access and Why

To provide its core functionality, TinyTab requires the following permissions:

- **Tabs & Tab Groups:** We read your open tab titles and URLs to generate short names and organize them into Chrome Tab Groups by domain.
- **Website Access (`<all_urls>`):** We require access to all websites solely to inject our content script that dynamically updates the shortened tab titles on the pages you visit. We do not read, process, or store the actual content of the web pages you browse.
- **Storage:** We use your browser's local storage to save your settings, preferences, and custom tab names. This data never leaves your device.

## Data Collection & Sharing

- **No Data Collection:** We do not collect, harvest, or transmit any personal data, browsing history, tab titles, or URLs to any external servers.
- **No Third-Party Tracking:** We do not use third-party analytics, tracking software, or external APIs. All processing (including name generation and grouping) happens strictly locally on your machine.
- **No Data Sharing:** We do not sell, rent, or share any information with third parties.

## Data Retention

Any data saved by TinyTab (such as your preferences or custom tab labels) is stored locally on your machine. You can delete this data at any time by clearing the extension's local storage or uninstalling the extension.
